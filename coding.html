			<p>I know HTML, CSS, and JS (duh! I made this website - it took 1 day, if you're wondering). My Replit profile is <a href="https://replit.com/@akhilpil0308">@akhilpil0308</a>. I know my way around any UNIX-based (MacOS, Linux) system with a bash shell, and I actually have some packages (<a href="https://bash-scripts.akhilzebra.repl.co/">https://bash-scripts.akhilzebra.repl.co/</a>) for Debian Linux that I made!<br>I also am familiar with Discord.js for Node.js, so I can make some basic Discord bots. If you would like one made, DM me or <a href="https://discord.gg/7hRKQCGDja">join my Discord server</a> and ping me.<br>BTW - I am always happy to help people with websites (primarily HTML and CSS) and any Linux shell scripts or packages. Just DM me on Discord or <a href="https://discord.gg/7hRKQCGDja">join my Discord server</a>, and then upload your project to <a href="https://replit.com">replit</a> or send me your code directly.<br><br>Links:<br><a href="https://nodejs-packages.akhilzebra.repl.co">My Node.js programs</a></p>
