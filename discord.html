		<p id="about-discord-server">When you join, make sure to read <i>#rules</i>. If you agree, type "I agree to the Server Rules" in <i>#rule-agreement</i>. If you do not agree, type "Proposal to change rules" instead.<br>If you really have a problem, DM me or ask me to create a private thread. I am happy to try to work something out! I am always open to advice, suggestions, and moderation help.<br>I do my best to frequently update roles for all users. I give out roles if I know a user fits a role requirement (i.e. they play Among Us, so they get the <i>@Among Us Players</i> role), or they deserve a higher role (i.e. I know a user has no infractions and is helping ot keep the server organized, so I would promote them from <i>@Knights</i> to <i>@Lords</i>). In the case that you would like to have a role that I have not given you yet, ask for it in <i>#role-request</i>. These roles would usually be <i>@Streamers</i>, <i>@Coders</i>, <i>@Knights</i>, <i>@Lords</i>, and <i>@Auditors</i>. If I have repeatedly neglected giving you a role, there is probably a reason, and you may DM me or ask me to create a private thread to talk about it.<br><i>#petitions-and-request</i> is always open if you want a bot added or any other changes made.</p>
