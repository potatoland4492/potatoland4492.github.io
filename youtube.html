			Looking for my YouTube channel? Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ9PvAWen0fXhiFl5sn_6sg">here</a> or search for "squeakynugget" on YouTube!<br>
			I barely ever have time to stream on my channel, but when I do, I may post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YvOmrMaor6VjtDUAYpj9bwNwrbrje3A">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YvOmrMaor6V5rguTvg7NguDFrLTZcrk">Random Games</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YvOmrMaor70LxornLIvq57jNlDxsxp4">Big Tower Tiny Square</a>, or coding (mostly HTML/CSS) videos. My Minecraft streams are mostly about random builds and tricks, and occasionally an idiotic mistake. I may decide to start streaming Among Us impostor failures. Clarification: I will stream Leafy's Impostor failures.<br>
